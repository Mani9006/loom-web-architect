## Workflow

2. Implement minimal and deterministic backend changes.
3. Validate auth behavior and error handling.
4. Run local checks and focused tests.
5. Document contract or env var changes in PR notes.

## Guardrails

- No hardcoded secrets.
- Keep backward compatibility unless explicitly approved.
- Fail closed on auth/security uncertainty.
