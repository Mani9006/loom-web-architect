## 1. Competitor Matrix

| Competitor   | Core Feature Set | Pricing (USD/mo) | Moat | Primary GTM Channel | ATS Check | Interview Prep | Job Tracker | AI-Native |
|-------------|-----------------|-----------------|------|---------------------|-----------|---------------|-------------|-----------|
| **Resume.io** | Template builder, export | ~$8 | Template library, brand | SEO/content | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| **Zety** | Template builder, cover letter | ~$24 | SEO dominance, content volume | SEO/content | Partial | ❌ | ❌ | Partial |
| **Kickresume** | AI builder, templates | ~$10 | Design quality, brand | Referral, SEO | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | Partial |
| **Enhancv** | Career builder, resume | ~$25 | Career narrative angle | Content/SEO | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | Partial |
| **Teal** | Job tracker, resume | Free / $29 | VC-backed, community | Viral/organic | Basic | ❌ | ✅ | Partial |
| **LinkedIn** | Network, profile, Easy Apply | Free / ~$40 | Network effect, distribution | Platform | ❌ | ❌ | Basic | ❌ |
| **ResumePreps** | AI resume + ATS + cover letter + interview prep + job tracker + contacts | Competitive | All-in-one career OS | SEO + product-led | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

### Key Observations
- No single competitor covers all five workflows (resume, ATS, cover letter, interview prep, job tracking) in one product.
- AI-native architecture is still rare; most incumbents bolted AI onto legacy template systems.
- Teal is the closest all-in-one challenger but lacks interview prep and AI-native architecture.
- LinkedIn has the distribution moat but an inferior tooling experience.

## 2. Strategic Wedges — Where ResumePreps Wins Decisively

### Wedge 1 — All-in-One Career OS
**Insight:** Job seekers switch between 4–7 tools per application cycle (resume builder → ATS checker → cover letter tool → interview prep → tracker). Each context switch is friction and churn opportunity for competitors.

**Win condition:** Be the single tab users never close during their job search.

**Activation play:** Onboarding flow that creates resume → runs ATS check → drafts cover letter → schedules mock interview, all in one session. Measure: time-to-first-value < 5 minutes.

### Wedge 2 — ATS Accuracy as Trust Engine
**Insight:** Most ATS tools give vague "scores". Hiring managers and candidates both distrust black-box results.

**Win condition:** Publish methodology, show specific keyword gap analysis, surface recommended rewrites inline. Make ATS transparency a brand pillar.

**Activation play:** Public ATS benchmark report comparing ResumePreps accuracy vs. competitors on real job descriptions. Refreshed monthly. Drives SEO + trust.

### Wedge 3 — Interview Prep ↔ Resume Feedback Loop
**Insight:** Interviewers ask questions directly tied to resume claims. No competitor closes this loop.

**Win condition:** After resume creation, auto-surface likely interview questions per bullet point. Offer mock interview for each question with AI feedback.

**Activation play:** "Interview Readiness Score" per resume section. Viral share hook: post readiness score to LinkedIn/X.

### Wedge 4 — AI-Native, Not AI-Bolted-On
**Insight:** Incumbents use AI as a feature label. ResumePreps is built AI-first at every layer (ATS analysis, cover letter generation, interview Q&A, job match scoring).

**Win condition:** Faster iteration, more personalized outputs, better data flywheel as users grow.

**Activation play:** Highlight model quality in onboarding ("Trained on 100K+ job descriptions") and publish improvement changelog.

### Wedge 5 — Free Tier with Real Value
**Insight:** Teal captured market share with a generous free tier. Users who feel value quickly convert and refer.

**Win condition:** Free tier that delivers a complete resume + ATS check + 1 cover letter, with upsell on volume and interview prep.

**Activation play:** Remove paywall friction from core value actions; monetize advanced AI features and unlimited usage.
